The Abstract Paintings application features a toolbar and a drawing area.
In the drawing area, a specified number of random geometric shapes can be generated: lines, triangles, ellipses, rectangles, Bezier curves, etc.
The spaces between the generated outlines should be able to be filled with various colors using the tools in the toolbar.
The application should allow saving and printing of the artworks.
